{"name":"MediaManager","tagline":"CD organization made easy.","body":"[MediaManager](http://georgw777.github.io/MediaManager/)\r\n============\r\n\r\nCD organization made easy. \r\n\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nMediaManager is an application, where you can enter in your CDs and DVDs. You can print stickers with QR codes that you can attach to your CDs in order to always find them. The media database can be edited directly in the application or in Microsoft Office Excel. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\nPlease note that this application was programmed in Visual Basic and therefore only works on the Windows operating system. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\nIf you want to do a full setup (install it on your computer) open [INSTALL](INSTALL) and execute [setup.exe](INSTALL/setup.exe). This will correctly install it on your machine. Alternatly, you can download `MediaManager-{latest-version}.zip` from the latest [release](../../releases). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Executable Only\r\nIf you do not want a full installation and just want to test it, navigate to [INSTALL/Application Files](INSTALL/Application Files) and open the latest version of MediaManager. Then, execute MediaManager.exe. Have fun! As mentioned above, you can download `MediaManager-{latest-version}.zip` from the latest [release](../../releases). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Problems\r\nIf you are encountering problems during the installation, it's probably because you did not download the whole [INSTALL](INSTALL) folder. The [setup.exe](INSTALL/setup.exe) file has to be able to access the [Application Files](INSTALL/Application Files) folder. \r\n\r\nAnother problem might be that you cannot start the application. If this is the case, make sure that the DLL [Main.dll](Main.dll) is located in the same directory as GamingBot.exe. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\n\r\nThe following libraries were used in this project: \r\n\r\n* [QrCode.Net](http://qrcodenet.codeplex.com/): an easy-to-use QR code library for the .NET framework\r\n* [Windows API Code Pack 1.1](http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/WindowsAPICodePack): access to Windows functions like TaskDialogs, which are not possible through the .NET framework\r\n* Main.dll: my own DLL for main application methods, ensuring consistent application behaviour\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
