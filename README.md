============

CD organization made easy. 


## About

MediaManager is an application, where you can enter in your CDs and DVDs. You can print stickers with QR codes that you can attach to your CDs in order to always find them. The media database can be edited directly in the application or in Microsoft Office Excel. 



## Libraries

The following libraries were used in this project: 

* [QrCode.Net](http://qrcodenet.codeplex.com/): an easy-to-use QR code library for the .NET framework
* [Windows API Code Pack 1.1](http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/WindowsAPICodePack): access to Windows functions like TaskDialogs, which are not possible through the .NET framework
* Main.dll: my own DLL for main application methods, ensuring consistent application behaviour
